          I began my career in the world of technical support, helping people
          solve hardware and software issues. My days were filled with
          troubleshooting, guiding users through fixes, and making sure their
          systems ran smoothly. While I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect, I
          found myself increasingly curious about how the technology I supported
          was actually built. That curiosity became a spark â€” a desire to go
          beyond fixing things to creating them.

          That spark led me to join the SheCodes free coding course for women,
          where I was introduced to the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. What started as a learning opportunity quickly turned into
          a passion. I loved seeing my code come to life on the screen and
          building projects from scratch. With each new challenge, my skills
          grew, and before long, I made the leap into becoming a front-end
          developer. Now, instead of just supporting technology, Iâ€™m creating
          digital experiences that others can enjoy and use.
